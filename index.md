The course is aimed at PhDs, postdocs and other researchers who are working on Dynamics and Evolution of Earth and Planets and are willing to learn Python. For the first 2 days you don't need to have any previous knowledge of python programming while for the last 3 days we build on the knowledge acquired during the beginning of the course towards advanced python programming.
