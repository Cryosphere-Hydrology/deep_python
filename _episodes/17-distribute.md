# Making sense of Software licensing

Software licensing is a complicated topic, but crucial when willing to share your code. 

A software license is an agreement between users and the owners of a software program  that allows users
 to do certain things that would otherwise be an infringement of copyright law. 
 
 The software license usually answers questions such as:

- Where and how and how often can you install the program?
- Can you copy, modify, or redistribute it?
- Can you look at the underlying source code?
- The price of the software and the licensing fees, if any, is sometimes discussed in the license agreement, but usually it's described elsewhere.

For this section, we will use the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) slides.

# Learn to write Software documentation with [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/)

We use [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) lesson on [code documentation](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/01-motivation/).


## Questions

- Is project documentation important? Why?
- How would you describe a useful documentation?
- How can you motivate your colleagues to contribute to the documentation?
- Does your project have a website? If not, do you think it could be good for
  the project?

## Why is project documentation important?

- You will probably use your code in the future and may forget details.
- You may want others to use your code (almost impossible without documentation).
- You may want others to contribute to the code.
- Shield your limited time and let the documentation answer FAQs.


## Software documentation in practice

- [Specs and requirements](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/02-requirements/)

- [Popular tools and solutions](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/03-tools/)

- [Sphinx and ReStructuredText](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/04-sphinx/)

- [Deploying Sphinx documentation to Read the Docs](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/05-rtd/)

- [Deploying a project website or homepage to GitHub Pages](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/06-gh-pages/)

# DevOps and automation

In this section we will be using [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) lesson on [DevOps and Automation](https://coderefinery.github.io/automation/).

- [Introduction to DevOps](https://coderefinery.github.io/automation/01-introduction-to-devops/)
